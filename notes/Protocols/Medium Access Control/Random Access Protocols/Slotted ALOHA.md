_Slotted ALOHA_ is a variant of a [[Random-Access Protocol|random-access protocol]] based on [[Pure ALOHA]], which takes concepts from [[Time Division Multiple Access|TDMA]].

The main difference to [[Pure ALOHA]] is that the channel becomes divided into **equal sized time slots**. Each [[Packetizing|frame]] can now only be transmitted at those times, increasing throughput because [[Packetizing|frames]] will never overlap.
