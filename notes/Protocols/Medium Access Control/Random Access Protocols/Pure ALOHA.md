_Pure ALOHA_ is a variant of a [[Random-Access Protocol|random-access protocol]] where:
- Any node may send a packet to any other node at a given moment
- When the packet is received, an acknowledgement is sent back to the original node
- If the original node does not receive this acknowledgement, then it will resend the packet
