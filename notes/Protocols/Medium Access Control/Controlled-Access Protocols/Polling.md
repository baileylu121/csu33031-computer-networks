_Polling_ is a variant of a [[Controlled-Access Protocol|controlled-access protocol]] where a **primary node** is responsible for controlling all communication. 

Unlike [[Reservation|reservation]] the primary node instead will **periodically contact** each node and ask if it has data to transmit, and then pass it to it's destination.
