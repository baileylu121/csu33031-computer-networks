_Code Division Multiple Access_ is a variant of a [[Controlled-Access Protocol|controlled-access protocol]] which makes use of the physical properties of interference to [[Multiplexing|multiplex]] multiple signals in the **transmission medium** at once.

> [!note]
> For _Code Division Multiple Access_ to work, the **exact signal amplitudes** for every source must be known in advance, making it difficult to implement.
