_Medium Access Control_ is the layer that controls the hardware responsible for direct interaction with the **transmission medium**.

> [!note]
> The **transmission medium** is the physical wire for a wired transmission or waves used for a wireless transmission.

It is introduced when multiple devices may want to access the same **transmission medium**, hence techniques like [[Multiplexing|multiplexing]] or [[Flow Control|flow control]] are required.

Additionally, it will encapsulate [[Packetizing|higher level frames]] with a header and padding if needed appropriate for the **transmission medium**.

# Multiple Access Protocols
There are a number of categories for _Multiple Access Protocols_, including:
- [[Random-Access Protocol|Random-Access Protocols]]
- [[Controlled-Access Protocol|Controlled-Access Protocols]]
- [[Channelisation Protocol|Channelisation Protocols]]
