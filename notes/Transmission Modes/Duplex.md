# Advantages

| Advantage                            | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-Speed Communication             | Fastest data transfer without delays before starting                                         |
| Suitable for real-time communication | Suitable for applications like video calls where communication is constant and bidirectional |
# Disadvantages

| Advantage  | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Complexity | Much more difficult to implement than other [[Transmission Mode\|transmission modes]] as it requires collision handling and [[Error Control\|error control]] |
| Cost       | Hardware costs are greater due to more complicated implementation                                                                                            |
