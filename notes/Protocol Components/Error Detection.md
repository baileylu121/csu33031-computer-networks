[]()There are a variety of ways to detect that an error has occurred for a given packet that has been received, including:
- [[Parity Check]]
- [[Cyclic Redundancy Check]]
- [[Checksum]]
These methods all make different trade-offs in terms of detecting the probability an error has occurred and the overhead of checking that an error has occurred.
